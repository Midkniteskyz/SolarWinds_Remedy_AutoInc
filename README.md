# SolarWinds_Remedy_AutoInc
Use SolarWinds alerts to automatically generate Remedy Incidents

## SolarWinds Remedy Auto Incident Generator

### Problem
The Enterprise Operations Support Center monitored SolarWinds for alerts within the environment. 
When the alerts triggered, personel had to manually create corresponding Remedy incidents.
On occassions, there would be an overwhelming amount of alerts, alerts would not be noticed, or incidents had incorrect information.

### Solution
Execute a script on alerts that will create Remedy Incidents, populating the incidents with relative information.

### Goals
- Reduce human error recording
- Improve time to create incidents
- Catch alerts that clear quickly
- Facilitate tabular navigation for improved user experience
